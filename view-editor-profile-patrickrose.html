            <p class="text">One of Dr. Rose’s main functions is to help reinforce existing preparedness capacity by providing training and conducting exercises to test real-world preparedness levels. The exercises range from discussion-based through full-scale exercises and focus on hospital preparedness, military-civilian coordination during mass casualty/medical surge scenarios, hospital evacuations following a direct disaster impact, and regional coordination following a mass casualty incident resulting from a Chemical, Biological, Radiological & Nuclear incident. One of his more recent efforts have been with the United States National Library of Medicine Disaster Information Management Research Center to create a virtual training programs to increase proficiencies in disaster response operations.</p>
