                    	<p class="text">Economic loss due to disasters has been increasing in spite of substantial progress in disaster risk reduction (DRR) policies promoted by the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA). Disaster interrupts or slows down economic growth by damaging public and private infrastructure, and by negatively affecting people and economic activities. To reduce the impacts of disasters, governments need to invest in  risk reduction. However, governments in most countries are suffering from tight budget constraints. The financial situation of low-income countries is often especially tight when we consider the debt and interest payment of these countries. Public investment, especially in low and lower middle-income countries, is very volatile. On the other hand, in spite of these constraints, public investment is significant, recently representing 6 to 10 % of GDP in developing countries. Governments must protect the hard-won fruits of these valuable investments.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p class="text small">The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, adopted at the Third UN World Conference for Disaster Risk Reduction in Sendai, Japan, in March 2015 , has a strong focus on the importance of risk sensitive public investment and financing.  In the Sendai Framework’s guiding principles, it clearly states that “addressing underlying disaster risk factors through disaster risk-informed public and private investments are more cost-effective than primary reliance on post-disaster response and recovery, and contribute to sustainable development”.  Accordingly, “investing in disaster risk reduction for resilience” is defined as one of the four priorities for action.</p>

                                <h4>What are the gaps to be filled?</h4>
                            </div>
                            <p class="text small">During the preceding Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) decade, the state of the art in risk assessment had shown significant progress. However, it is widely recognized that risk information has not yet translated into concrete DRR investment. In this regard, it is important to focus on the lack of linkages between natural science and social science, particularly economics. Risk information produced by natural scientists is often not well linked to cost information as researched and analyzed by social scientists. Even when risk information exists, if it is not linked to cost information, it is difficult to promote investment in DRR. For example, in the Solomon Islands states, “If policies based on risk information would lead to increased project costs, budget constraints may limit utilization of the risk information. Promoting cost benefit analysis is necessary in order to counteract this “ (HFA progress report 2013) .</p>
                            <p class="text small">Related to the lack of cost information is an issue of opportunity cost. Ministries of Finance are not concerned only about disaster risk. They need to respond to other competing priorities. In many countries, disaster risk reduction is not a high priority and policymakers tend to allocate already limited financial resources to other urgent needs such as poverty reduction, education and public health. It is also difficult to explain the urgency surrounding disaster risk reduction, a challenge that often leads to problems securing financial resources. A classic dilemma for policy makers is whether they can justify giving up investment in immediate growth opportunities, and instead invest in DRR. In other words, risk needs to be examined through a socio-economic lens in each country.</p>

                                <h4>Key Questions to Tackle</h4>
                            </div>
                            <p class="text small">In the disaster risk management (DRM) cycle, response, recovery and reconstruction also place pressure on the allocation of disaster risk reduction budgets. Reconstruction and compensation for those affected is imminently needed in the majority of cases. In such situations, budget restructuring following a disaster often takes money away from DRR for the use in reconstruction. To assure sufficient funding for DRR investment, it is necessary to be able to explain and justify the cost effectiveness of the DRR investment –as compared to expenditure in disaster response and reconstruction.</p>
                            <p class="text small">The key questions that governments must tackle are: "How much money should be allocated to disaster risk management in total?”; and, “How to decide which is the most efficient and effective allocation of money between risk reduction and risk financing?” Subsequently, more specific issues need to be examined: the design of risk sensitive investment mechanisms and risk financing mechanisms (i.e. the appropriate combination of contingency funds, insurance and other tools).</p>
                            <p class="text small">To address these questions under the Hyogo Framework for Action, in 2012, the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) started a global project, financed by the European Union, for some 30 countries titled: “Building Capacities for Increased Public Investment in Integrated Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Reduction: 2012-2015”. The Southwest Indian Ocean region was the first to complete the full process. In cooperation with the Indian Ocean Commission, the project targeted four island countries as well as the Government of Zanzibar, Tanzania.</p>
                            <p class="text small">This programme was composed of three components: the establishment of reliable disaster loss databases (Component 1); risk evaluation and probabilistic risk assessment profiles (Component 2); and, incorporation of disaster risk reduction into public investment planning through economic analysis and investment policy reviews(Component 3).</p>
                            <p class="text small">As a first step (Component 1), a total of 3,235 entries, or “data cards”, on disaster events and losses between 1980 and 2013 were registered in the national disaster loss databases of these countries. Economic loss totalled USD 17.2 billion (2012 constant price), out of which 96% was due to intensive and extensive cyclones. In the subsequent probabilistic risk analysis (Component2), Average Annual Loss (AAL) for tropical cyclonic wind and earthquake combined across the region was estimated at USD 161.43 million, with a Probable Maximum Loss (PML) of USD 1,466 million for a 50-year return period.</p>
                            <p class="text small">This loss and risk information pointed to the need to reduce tropical cyclone risk in the region. However, in itself it did not suggest policy guidance. Grounded in the loss and risk analysis, a thorough policy review and economic analysis were implemented (Component 3).</p>
                            <p class="text small">A model to devise public financing strategies for pre- and post-disaster contexts, CATSIM analysis developed by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) identified the fiscal resource gap year (i.e. the return period at which the government will face difficulty in raising sufficient funds for reconstruction) for tropical cyclone and earthquake hazards in each country. The gaps for the IOC islands were between 24 and 329 years (Madagascar and Seychelles, respectively). Drawing from the risk layer based approach, because of their high volume of extensive risk and their low fiscal gap years, it was judged to be more beneficial and effective for Madagascar and Comoros to focus on risk reduction efforts while Mauritius and Seychelles should also start to explore risk-financing mechanisms.</p>
                            <p class="text small">The following probabilistic cost benefit analysis (CBA) presents how CBA can support concrete and specific evidence-based decision making. A specific scenario and project was examined (i.e. housing retrofitting or water drainage) for each island using probabilistic (forward or backward looking) methods, and a Net Present Value (NPV) for each was determined. Three of the five efforts studied were determined to be cost-effective. Key variables and updated damage and cost information were lacking to produce a more useful CBA especially in the cases that the NPV was negative.</p>
                            <p class="text">Based on these findings, current disaster risk reduction policy in the Indian Ocean region and particularly public finance (including DRR investment and risk financing mechanisms) were examined. In spite of much progress in HFA implementation and disaster management systems, no definite and systematic DRR investment policy exists in the IOC countries. Several sectorial ministries on all five islands make risk sensitive investment implicitly. Cost benefit analysis, when required for large-scale projects, does not take disaster risk into consideration. Critical infrastructure is not sufficiently protected against disaster risk. Contingency financing mechanisms are also under-developed.</p>

                                <h4>Exploring National DRR Investment</h4>
                            </div>
                            <p class="text small">To explore the financial aspects of disaster risk management policy, each country also estimated the current investment in DRM by applying a DRM marker method in an examination of national budgets, proposed for the OECD by the World Bank in partnership with UNISDR.</p>
                            <p class="text small">Results determined that between 2 and 16% of the studied budgets is invested in DRM, implicitly or explicitly in any given year, corresponding to approximately USD 457 million. Overall, more than twice as much marked effort is categorized as “significant” (as opposed to “principle”), demonstrating that they are embedded in development projects --mainstreamed into development. The general trend points to greater investment in preventive / mitigation disaster risk reduction action for Mauritius, Seychelles and Zanzibar; and investment in response for Madagascar and Comoros.</p>
                            <p class="text small">A comparison of annual investment in disaster risk management to disaster risk (Average Annual Loss - AAL) and observed historic loss determined that among the five islands, Madagascar suffers the greatest gap, pointing to the need for greater disaster risk reduction investment. Most countries identified that for the budget review to be more meaningful, it needs to more carefully capture and track investment related to specific hazards.</p>
                            <p class="text small">During several meetings with representatives of the Ministries of Finance in the IOC region, it was established that a scattered approach to DRM is inefficient and that there is a clear need for stronger collaboration between the DRM agency, Ministry of Finance and other key sectorial ministries. Continuous capacity building on risk terminology and concepts, loss and risk information management and economic analysis was recommended by Ministries of Finance in the region.</p>
                            <p class="text small">The loss and risk information should be examined from the perspective of both DRM policy maker and financial planners. Given the importance of public investment in disaster risk reduction, continuous refinement of loss and risk information should be promoted through regular dialogue with data users. In the process of economic analysis, Ministries of Finance understood and appreciated the importance of loss and risk information. In some cases, they identified several mistakes and inconsistencies in the records of disaster loss databases and as a consequence the data were corrected. Such exchanges of information improve the overall quality of knowledge management to support DRM decision making.</p>
                            <p class="text small">Government needs to develop investment and financing strategies to address both extensive (small scale but high frequency) and intensive (low frequency but high impact) risks. Climate change will increase risks in terms of frequency, geography and intensity. Understanding risk situations and the expected economic impact in the country is a critical first step to determine the optimum policy mix for each risk layer. In developing investment and financing strategies to address disaster risk, DRR investment and risk financing should not be considered separately. Depending on risk layers, the most appropriate policy mix changes and DRR investment and risk financing are not mutually exclusive. For example, investment in disaster risk reduction often decreases insurance premiums.</p>
                            <p class="text small">This packaged approach with a focus on financial planners in government will be standardized and replicated in Asia, Africa, Latin America and other regions in the coming years. Furthermore, this knowledge will be presented globally in a working paper series of UNISDR on “Public Investment and Financing Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction”. The report summarizing the activities in IOC region will thereby contribute to increasing the global knowledge base.</p>

                            <p class="text small">Although “risk as opportunity” has become an attractive political motto, on the ground disaster risk simply represents costs for financial planners (both public and private) and society. While we often focus on disaster loss and impacts, the overall cost of disaster risk is a summation of:</p>
                            <ol class="text small letter">

                            <p class="text small">However, most countries do not have disaster risk management labelling or dedicated budget lines for DRM in their public accounting system. So they don’t know how much they actually spend on disaster risk reduction, response and reconstruction. Sectorial disaster risk reduction is especially hard to label, as it is often embedded in larger projects. For example, earthquake proof school building is included under the larger category of school building so that the part of budget dedicated to strengthen the facility is not visible, making investment tracking almost impossible.</p>
                            <p class="text small">Not having a DRM budget monitoring system results in an inefficient use of resources and lack of funding. Without knowing their current budget status, countries cannot properly evaluate the current level of DRM and estimate how much funding is required to further promote DRM activities. Nepal, which was severely hit by earthquakes very recently, claimed: “The budget allocated for disaster preparedness and mitigation is spread among different projects which render it ineffective. There is a need to develop and implement a financial tracking system to monitor all disaster risk reduction related expenditures for mitigation, preparedness and emergency response” (Nepal HFA progress report 2013).</p>
                            <p class="text small">National governments assume the primary responsibility to protect people and assets from disasters, and the risk preventive infrastructure represents public goods to remedy the problem due to market failure. In economics, public goods are characterized both as non-excludable and non-rivalrous in that individuals cannot be effectively excluded from use, and use by one individual does not reduce availability to others. Disaster risk reduction mechanisms are also public goods that satisfy the conditions of non-excludability and no-rivalry. Sea walls and early warning systems protect people and assets and do not exclude anyone. The problem of public goods is that no one wants to pay for the service and the goods are likely to be under-produced (i.e. the free-rider problem - in economics, this refers to a situation where some individuals in a population either consume more than their fair share of a common resource, or pay less than their fair share of the cost of a common resource).</p>
                            <p class="text small">The argument of public goods is closely related to market failure in economic theory. Market failure is a situation in which the allocation of goods and services by free market is not efficient. Market failures are scenarios in which the individual pursuit of pure self-interest leads to results that are not efficient – and that can be improved upon from the societal point of view. The typical causes that lead to market failures include lack of information, externalities, or public goods. When the private sector does not properly assess the disaster risk, it tends to over-invest. While it is important for all members of society to properly recognize disaster risk, risk assessment is often costly and beyond the capacity of small and medium enterprises.</p>
                            <p class="text small">Furthermore, the impact of disasters can be felt beyond private sector investment and spill over to society (e.g. a damaged factory interrupts traffic and prevents response activity or interrupts production causing income decrease of the employee). In this case, portions of disaster costs are transferred to others in society. This phenomenon is called negative externality in economics. When externality exists, the private sector does not have incentives to decrease investment in hazard prone areas even if they properly understand the risk. Government needs to commit to disaster risk reduction mechanisms precisely to provide sufficient risk information to society and thereby remedy the lack of information and externality problem.</p>
                            <p class="text small">Assuring sufficient disaster risk reduction mechanisms reduces exposed and/or vulnerable areas and facilitates private investment in such areas. In this sense, disaster risk reduction mechanisms constitute important infrastructure supporting the economic development of society. That is also a reason why government needs to commit to integrating disaster risk in public investment planning.</p>
                            <p class="text small">In spite of decentralization trends, the role of national governments does not diminish. Disaster risk reduction infrastructure, such as sea walls, are often very costly and beyond the financial capacity of local governments. Given the positive externality of such infrastructure, national governments are fully justified to financially commit in the investment. Catastrophes such as the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 (just before the HFA adoption) and the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 (whose experience influenced Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction) clearly put the attention on what the role of national government is regarding the need to review their capability to prepare for and respond to intensive disaster risk. In the context of developing countries, accumulated impacts of low-to-mid scale disasters diminishes local level capacity and support will often be needed from national governments.</p>
                            <p class="text small">In case of catastrophe, horizontal risk transfer mechanisms such as insurance may often not be sufficient. Disaster risk reduction investment is, unlike risk transfer mechanisms, considered inter-generational risk sharing. Following the definition of sustainable development by the Brundtland Committee, only development that addresses the existing risks without compromising the ability of future generations to address them should be promoted. In summary, public investment in disaster risk reduction is theoretically sound and the commitment of national level government is critical in spite of decentralization trends.</p>
